# Inventory System

Looking at Inventree which is an Inventory Management System designed for intuitive parts management and stock control

## Ask Grok 3 about it

Have you seen Inventree, the Open Source Inventory Management System.

> Yes, I'm familiar with InvenTree, ... provides robust low-level stock control and part tracking ... web-based admin interface and a REST API...

I want to import JSON files from a git repo that holds parts data. I'd like to know an optimal format for the JSON files.

> To import parts data into InvenTree from JSON files ...
> Recommended JSON Structure ... The JSON file should be an array of objects, where each object represents a part with fields corresponding to InvenTree’s Part model. Categories must exist before importing parts.
> File Organization: Store JSON files in a clear structure within the Git repository, e.g., /parts/electronics/resistors.json, /parts/electronics/capacitors.json. Use descriptive filenames and maintain a README.md to document the structure and fields.

I asked about Inventree the other day, do you recall that?

> Yes, I remember our conversation about InvenTree. You were exploring its features for parts management and stock control,
> asking about JSON file imports from a Git repository, the default_location field, and automating shelf lighting for part
> location. You also mentioned wanting a fun circuit board image with glowing golden traces. How can I assist you further with InvenTree or anything else?

The IPN variable in the parts object refers to? Should I use the manufacturing part number or generate my own PN? If I generate my own PN for the IPN variable, then where or how do I associate the manufacturing PN with it?

> In InvenTree, the IPN variable in the parts object refers to the Internal Part Number. This is a unique identifier you assign to a part within your InvenTree database to track it internally. 
> It’s distinct from the Manufacturer Part Number (MPN), which is the part number assigned by the manufacturer of the component.

...

> Should You Use the Manufacturer Part Number or Generate Your Own IPN?
> Using the Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) as the IPN: This can work if the MPN is unique across all your parts and you don’t need a custom internal numbering system. However, MPNs are not always unique (e.g., different manufacturers might use similar MPNs), and they may not align with your organization’s internal processes or naming conventions. Using MPNs as IPNs can also make it harder to manage parts if manufacturers change their numbering or if you source equivalent parts from multiple suppliers.

...

> Generating Your Own IPN: This is generally recommended for better control and consistency. A custom IPN allows you to create a standardized, unique identifier that fits your organization’s workflow, regardless of external MPNs. It’s particularly useful for:
>> Parts sourced from multiple manufacturers with different MPNs but the same function.
>> Custom or in-house parts that don’t have an MPN.
>> Avoiding conflicts if MPNs overlap or change.
>> How to Generate Your Own IPN

...

> If you choose to generate your own IPN, you can create a numbering scheme that suits your needs. Common approaches include:
> Prefix-based: Use a prefix for the part category (e.g., RES-0001 for resistors, IC-0001 for integrated circuits).
> Sequential: Assign sequential numbers (e.g., PART-0001, PART-0002).
> Hierarchical: Incorporate category, subcategory, or project codes (e.g., ELEC-RES-0001 for an electronic resistor).
> You can define the IPN manually when creating a part in InvenTree or automate it using a script or plugin if you’re importing parts in bulk (e.g., via JSON files, as you mentioned previously).

...

> Associating the Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) with Your IPN
> To link the MPN to your custom IPN in InvenTree, you use the Manufacturer Part object, which associates a part in your database with its manufacturer and MPN. Here’s how to do it:

...

> Create the Part in InvenTree:
> When creating a part, assign your custom IPN in the IPN field of the part object.
> Fill in other relevant fields like name, description, and default_location (as you’ve explored before).
> Link the Manufacturer Part:
> In InvenTree, go to the part’s detail page and navigate to the Manufacturers tab (or equivalent, depending on your interface).
> Add a Manufacturer Part entry:
> Select the manufacturer (you may need to create a manufacturer record in InvenTree first).
> Enter the MPN provided by the manufacturer.
> Optionally, link to a supplier and supplier part number (SPN) if you’re tracking purchasing details.
> This creates a relationship between your internal part (with its IPN) and the external MPN.
> Via JSON Import:
> If you’re importing parts using JSON files (as you mentioned previously), include the manufacturer details in the import structure. For example:

```JSON
{
  "IPN": "RES-0001",
  "name": "10k Ohm Resistor",
  "description": "1/4W 10k Ohm 5% Resistor",
  "manufacturer_parts": [
    {
      "manufacturer": "Yageo",
      "MPN": "CFR-25JT-52-10K"
    },
    {
      "manufacturer": "Vishay",
      "MPN": "MFR-25FBF52-10K"
    }
  ]
}
```

> Ensure the manufacturer_parts field maps the IPN to one or more MPNs. You’ll need to have the manufacturers defined in InvenTree’s database beforehand or include them in the import.
> Automation:
> If you’re automating imports or updates (e.g., via a Git repository), you can write a script to populate the manufacturer_parts table programmatically using InvenTree’s API. The API endpoint for parts allows you to POST or PATCH manufacturer part data, linking MPNs to your IPN.

...

> Best Practices

```TEXT
Consistency: Stick to a clear IPN naming convention to avoid confusion (e.g., avoid reusing IPNs or creating ambiguous ones).
Multiple MPNs: If a part can be sourced from multiple manufacturers, associate all relevant MPNs with the same IPN to allow flexibility in purchasing.
Documentation: Ensure your IPN-to-MPN mappings are well-documented in InvenTree to avoid errors during ordering or stock management.
Validation: When importing JSON files, validate that MPNs and manufacturers exist in the database to prevent orphaned records.
```

> Additional Notes
> If you’re using InvenTree’s API or plugins for automation, check the InvenTree API documentation for endpoints related to parts and manufacturer parts.
For shelf lighting automation (as you mentioned before), you could extend your IPN system to include location data in the IPN or part metadata, which could be used to trigger specific lighting based on the part’s default_location.
> If you need help with a specific JSON import example, API setup, or integrating this with your shelf lighting project, let me know! Also, since you mentioned a fun circuit board image last time, would you like me to generate one for you now to visualize your parts management setup?

> Importing the JSON

```TEXT
Manual Import via Web Interface:
Log in to your InvenTree instance.
Navigate to Settings > Companies (or equivalent, depending on your version).
Use the Import Companies feature (if available in your InvenTree version) or a similar data import tool.
Upload the JSON file or paste the JSON content into the provided field.
Map the JSON fields to the corresponding InvenTree Company model fields (e.g., name, description, etc.).
Submit the import to create the manufacturer records.
Using the InvenTree API:
You can use the InvenTree API to import manufacturers programmatically. The endpoint for creating companies is typically /api/company/.
```

> Example using curl to POST the JSON data:

```bash

> Notes

```TEXT
Prerequisites: Ensure you have admin access to InvenTree to import companies or use the API.
API Documentation: Check the InvenTree API documentation for the exact endpoint and fields, as they may vary slightly depending on your InvenTree version.
Git Integration: If you’re managing JSON files in a Git repository (as you mentioned previously), you can automate the import process using a CI/CD pipeline or script that pushes the JSON to the InvenTree API.
Error Handling: If an import fails due to duplicate names or missing fields, InvenTree will return an error. Check the logs or API response for details.
If you need help with scripting the import, integrating with your Git repository, or combining this with your shelf lighting automation, let me know! Also, would you like me to generate that fun circuit board image with glowing golden traces to visualize your parts management setup?

## Notes

I skipped past a lot of Grok's content, including the implementation of lighting a shelf. It's unbelievable that Grok can do all that, but I'll need to provide more details to have it engineer what I'm looking for. The above was the first engineering-level problem I have asked an AI, and it has surpassed my expectations. However, after that, I asked it to generate an image of a circuit board layout like an Arduino Uno (just for fun), and it was unable to understand what I wanted. AI may need to be trained with images of some circuit board layouts to get past that sort of problem, or maybe the Grok developers are trying to protect their relevance.
